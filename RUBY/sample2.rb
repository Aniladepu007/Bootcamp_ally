# 20)text = ”I am learning ruby2”

# •	Check “am” is there using match method
# •	Check number is there using scan method


# 17) Write a Ruby code that will add two integer numbers. If we enter any string in the input it should handle the exception.
# Expected Output
# a= 10, b = 20
# •	a+ b = 30
# a = 10 +  b=”25”
# •	a+b =0 =>Error


# 6)  a)Write a ruby code for Fibonacci Series

#       b)Take a input and check the value is “string” ,”float” or “integer” using case statement

# 7) Write a program for getting your name,age,mark1,mark2 and mark3(use if)

# Display the result as
# Name
# Age
# Mark 1
# Mark 2
# Mark 3
# Total
# Result : Pass / Fail(if any mark below 40 is fail)
 
# 8)

# the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'apricots']
# change = [1, 'pennies', 2, 'dimes', 3, 'quarters']

# Expected output

# This is count 1
# This is count 2
# This is count 3
# This is count 4
# This is count 5
# A fruit of type: apples
# A fruit of type: oranges
# A fruit of type: pears
# A fruit of type: apricots
# I got 1
# I got pennies
# I got 2
# I got dimes
# I got 3
# I got quarters


# 9) Work out array
# a = [2,4,3,"ruby",9.99]
# reverse the above array
# sort the above array
# 10) Try the following methods of Hash
# keys
# values
# clone
# each
# delete







# the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'apricots']
# change = [1, 'pennies', 2, 'dimes', 3, 'quarters']

# the_count.each{|k| puts("This is count #{k}")}
# fruits.each{|k| puts("A fruit of type: #{k}")}
# change.each{|k| puts("I got #{k}")}
